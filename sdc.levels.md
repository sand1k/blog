SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) levels:
1. Level 0. No driving automation
2. Level 1. Driver assistance (Hands on)

    A single automated system for driver assistance, such as steering or acceleration (cruise control).
    
    Example: ACC (adaptive cruise control), where the vehicle can be kept at a safe distance behind the next car, qualifies as Level 1 because the human driver monitors the other aspects of driving such as steering and braking.

3. Level 2. Partial driving automation (Hands off)

    This means ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems). The vehicle can control both steering and accelerating/deaccelerating.

    Examples: Tesla autopilot, Cadillac (General Motors) Super Cruise systems.

4. Level 3. Conditional driving automation (eyes off)

    Level 3 vehicles have "environmental detection" capabilities and can make informed decision for themselves, such as accelerating past a slow moving vehicle. But - they still require a human override.

    Legal requirements of the international UN-R157 for a Level 3 system enabling conditionally automated driving.

    Audi A8L with Traffic Jam Pilot - was not released to public.
    Mercedes Drive Pilot - 2022, Mercedes S class, Mercedes EQS SUV.
    Volvo Ride Pilot - Volvo XC90, Polestar 3 SUV.
    BMW 7 - 2023.
    GM - ultra cruise ADAS, 2023.

5. Level 4. High driving automation (mind off)

    Level 4 vehicles can intervene if things go wrong or there is a system failure. In this sense, these cars do not require human interaction in most circumstances. However, a human still has the option to manually override.

    Level 4 vehicles can operate in self-driving mode. But until legislation and infrastructure evolves, they can only do so within a limited area (usually an urban environment where top speeds reach an average of 30mph). This is known as geofencing. As such, most Level 4 vehicles in existence are geared toward ridesharing. For example:

    - NAVYA, a French company, is already building and selling Level 4 shuttles and cabs in the U.S. that run fully on electric power and can reach a top speed of 55 mph.
    - Alphabet's Waymo recently unveiled a Level 4 self-driving taxi service in Arizona, where they had been testing driverless cars―without a safety driver in the seat―for more than a year and over 10 million miles.
    - Canadian automotive supplier Magna has developed technology (MAX4) to enable Level 4 capabilities in both urban and highway environments. They are working with Lyft to supply high-tech kits that turn vehicles into self-driving cars.
    - Just a few months ago, Volvo and Baidu announced a strategic partnership to jointly develop Level 4 electric vehicles that will serve the robotaxi market in China.

6. Level 5. Full driving automation

    Level 5 vehicles do not require human attention―the “dynamic driving task” is eliminated. Level 5 cars won’t even have steering wheels or acceleration/braking pedals. They will be free from geofencing, able to go anywhere and do anything that an experienced human driver can do. Fully autonomous cars are undergoing testing in several pockets of the world, but none are yet available to the general public.
